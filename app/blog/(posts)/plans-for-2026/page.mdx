# let's build another satellite because, why not?
i first got into cubesat development when i did beaver works summer institute's build a cubesat course in the summer of 2023. i think the process of building a cubesat is one of the coolest ways to really deepen your engineering skills and technical knowledge. you will also start thinking more like a systems engineer. launching spacecraft is also heavily regulated, so you'll have to work within strict guidelines and standards set by federal agencies. i'd probably like to center this project around interesting RF or optical communications technologies.

# diving deeper into hilbert space
as the new projects director for QuantUM, michigan's only undergraduate club focused on quantum science and quantum computing, i'm setting out to build the biggest student-led project team for quantum technology in the midwest. my technical knowledge in quantum computing is pretty limited to basic algorithms and quantum error correction codes implemented in qiskit i learned from eecs 479 (intro to quantum computing), so i'm looking to start more hardware-focused quantum projects and pursue more advanced research.
