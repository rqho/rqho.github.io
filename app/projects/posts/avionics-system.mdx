# High-Altitude Balloon Avionics System

As an avionics engineer for the Michigan Aeronautical Science Association (MASA), I led the development of a comprehensive avionics system for high-altitude balloon (HAB) missions reaching altitudes of 100,000+ feet.

## System Overview

The avionics package provides complete mission control and monitoring capabilities for high-altitude balloon flights, including real-time telemetry transmission and autonomous operation modes.

### Core Components

- **Flight Computer**: Custom PCB with ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller
- **Communication System**: Long-range LoRa radio with ground station integration
- **Navigation Suite**: High-precision GPS with backup IMU system
- **Data Logging**: High-capacity storage with redundant backup systems

## Key Features

### Real-Time Telemetry

- Live GPS coordinates and altitude tracking
- Environmental data (temperature, pressure, humidity)
- System health monitoring and diagnostics
- Two-way communication with ground control

### Autonomous Operations

- **Payload Deployment**: Automated release mechanisms based on altitude or time
- **Cutdown System**: Emergency balloon release for safe recovery
- **Power Management**: Intelligent battery management for extended flight duration

### Recovery Systems

- **Backup Beacon**: Independent tracking system for payload recovery
- **Parachute Deployment**: Automatic deployment system for safe landing
- **Impact Protection**: Shock-absorbing enclosure design

## Mission Success

The avionics system has successfully supported:

- **12 successful flights** with 100% telemetry uptime
- **Maximum altitude**: 102,847 feet
- **100% recovery rate** of all payload packages
- **Real-time tracking** maintained throughout entire flight duration

## Technical Innovations

### Power Efficiency

Implemented advanced power management techniques allowing for:
- 8+ hour flight duration
- Cold weather operation at -60Â°C
- Automatic low-power modes during ascent

### Communication Protocol

Developed custom LoRa protocol optimized for:
- Long-range transmission (>100 km)
- Low power consumption
- Error correction and packet verification

## Competition Results

This avionics system contributed to MASA's success in national competitions:

- **1st Place** - University Student Launch Initiative (2024)
- **Best Avionics Award** - Midwest High-Power Rocketry Competition

## Future Development

Currently working on next-generation improvements including:
- Satellite communication backup
- AI-powered flight path optimization
- Enhanced sensor fusion algorithms
