# Quantum Circuit Simulator

A comprehensive quantum circuit simulator built for educational purposes and quantum computing research. This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics through interactive visualizations and real-time calculations.

## Features

- **Interactive Circuit Builder**: Drag and drop quantum gates to build complex circuits
- **Real-time Visualization**: See quantum state evolution as you modify circuits
- **Multiple Qubit Support**: Simulate circuits with up to 10 qubits
- **Educational Mode**: Step-by-step explanations of quantum phenomena

## Technical Implementation

The simulator uses WebGL for high-performance rendering of quantum state visualizations. The core quantum mechanics calculations are implemented using optimized linear algebra operations, allowing for real-time simulation of quantum circuits.

### Key Algorithms

- Quantum state vector evolution
- Gate matrix multiplication optimization
